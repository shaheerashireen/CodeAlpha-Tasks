# CodeAlpha Task 4 – Sentiment Analysis

# Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on text data to understand public opinion and emotional tone. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were used to classify text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

# Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze text data, detect sentiment patterns, and interpret how these sentiments can be used for business, marketing, and social insights.

# Dataset
A mixed dataset containing 30 text samples was used. The data represents content similar to:
- Amazon product reviews
- Social media comments
- News-related text
Each text entry was labeled with its source to compare sentiment patterns across different platforms.

# Methodology
- Python was used for implementation in Google Colab
- The TextBlob library was used for sentiment analysis
- NLP lexicons were applied to calculate:
  - Polarity (positive or negative strength)
  - Subjectivity (opinion-based or factual text)
- Texts were classified as Positive, Negative, or Neutral
  
# Analysis Performed
- Sentiment classification for each text entry
- Identification of overall sentiment distribution
- Comparison of sentiment patterns across different data sources
- Visualization of sentiment counts using a bar chart

# Key Insights
- Amazon reviews and social media texts showed more emotional responses
- News-related texts were mostly neutral and informational
- Negative sentiments indicate areas for improvement
- Positive sentiments highlight strengths that can be used in marketing

# Conclusion
This sentiment analysis helped in understanding public opinion and emotional trends across different text sources. The insights derived from the analysis can support marketing strategies, product development decisions, and social awareness initiatives.

# Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- TextBlob
